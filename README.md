# Hi

I'm Raphael, I like programming, I write kernels for fun, and this repo contains some of the code that I reference in some of my articles.

This code is public domain.

This code is not working as it. It depends on the codebase that I've been building for the last 5 years to even compile.

Though, it may contain some info that you may find interesting when reimplementing your own stuff, so I hope you find it usefull.

Cheers.
