# Hi

I'm Raphael, I like programming, I write kernels for fun, and this repo contains some of the code that I reference in some of my articles.

This code is public domain.

This code is not working as it. It depends on the codebase that I've been building for the last 5 years to even compile.

Though, it may contain some info that you may find interesting when reimplementing your own stuff, so I hope you find it usefull.

Cheers.

# Stuff you may find here : 

## ksn.[hc]

The platform-independent part of the KASAN I wrote for my kernel.

Mostly focuses on attributes management.

## aarch32_dec.h

An ARM32 (aarch32) decoder I generated with a program that I wrote to (guess what) generate decoders.

I switched the encodings of two instructions, will you find which ;) ?

Fun fact : it also works as a great way to make github lag.
