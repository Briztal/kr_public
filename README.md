# Hi

I'm Raphael, like programming, I write kernels for fun, and this repo contains some of the code that I reference in some of my articles.

This code is public domain.

This code is not working as it. It depends on the codebase that I've been working on for the last 5 years to even compile.

Though, it may contain some info that you may find interesting when remimplementing your own stuff, so I hope you find it usefull.

Cheers.
